# How many pizzas?

It's always kinda tricky to figure out how many pizzas you should order for a large
group of people. [How Many Pizzas? (HMP)][3] take away any guesswork!

[Originally built way back in 2013][4], this modern version of the tool has been
rebuilt using Vite, VueJS and TailwindCSS. 

You can just [use the tool yourself][3] by going to [https://howmanypizzas.net][3],
or you can run the code yourself.
